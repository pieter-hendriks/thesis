Thesis progress:
	Syntax algorithm:
		Implementation implicitly assumed constant time steps; corrected this assumption. 
			When an interval operator was computed, all values with time > max(time) - max(interval) were dropped, but if timer resolution changed
			somewhere in the list (i.e. in case an extra zero is computed when two signals intersect) this may drop information. 
			This appears to be the cause of the Syntax algorithm not finding the extra timestamps that the efficient algorithm does.
			A correct implementation hereof should eliminate the need of an extra Signal comparison function (though that has been implemented now). 
				Based on this observation, I've removed the use of the Signal comparison function again in the script I was using to test this.
