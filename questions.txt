CNN:
	We can't compute the same timesteps that the algorithms are computing
		there's no way to determine which timesteps they will be without computing all results (except for last binary operation) and computing the intersections
		Is it sufficient to say that input signals must have the same increment (we can compute interpolated values if necessary - creating discretized time) between all checkpoints
		and then only compute robustness for those times?
			This means that we will miss some timestamps the algorithm will find; but I think that's unavoidable anyway? 
			We can't really pre-compute what the result timesteps will be without computing almost the entire formula
		
	Sliding window is some size X; if we have differently sized timesteps, this won't always cover the same interval -- performance would thus depend on how variable the timesteps are. Seems bad.
	Discretized time: We can't predict where the intersections will be, so only way to make meaningful computations is too have data at all times
		Since Signal currently allows up to 1e-5 precision, that'd be a very large signal. Probably bad performance?
	Sliding window at x size; determine time using furthest timestep
