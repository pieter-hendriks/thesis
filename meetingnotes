case study laurens report
	Else getting values from running code

Signal described with difference between signal results for short vs long alg

Planning:
	~4 months of time
	Software Engineering: 
		Report on coverage of test suite: need to report on increased confidence
		Specifically include bug reported in Laurens' thesis
	Ask Guillermo & Ritam for help in fixing the algorithm
	Extend either case study or algorithmic:
		
		
	Original plan:
		Use monitor, get data to train NN to approximate monitor
			== feasibility study
		Pick some openAI examples, run robustness algorithm, then train net on this
	
	NN for each logical formula?
	recursive neural net makes more sense, probably
	
	Advantage neural net:
		Sometimes timesteps can't be computed for timestep X, because lookahead required
		NN estimates 
		
	Cartpole environment + add a few more?
		mountaincar, pendulum ... Many others - see openAI
	
	Complex formula --> probably worse performance
	
	Recurrent neural network (convolution required?)
		Probably easier to do safety (i.e. never go outside these bounds) vs achievability (i.e. at some point,x is achieved)
		
Learning around late feb
