	Implementatie:
		✔ Move syntax algorithm into stl.operations @done (5/19/2022, 3:18:03 PM)
		✔ Move boolean validations into stl.operations? @done (5/19/2022, 3:26:10 PM)
		✔ Fix current tests @done (5/19/2022, 1:31:17 PM)
		✘ Fix timed eventually: do shift + get unique timestamps, base window on that list @cancelled (5/19/2022, 1:49:54 PM)
					Unnecessary -> given some <t, v> max, after it disappears, we don't suddenly put the new max at time t. Instead, the new max should appear at the time of the next checkpoint so there's a smooth line
		✔ Timed always update filter to reflect correct implementation (see timeduntil) @done (5/19/2022, 2:51:04 PM)
		✔ Timed eventually add timestamp filter @done (5/19/2022, 2:51:04 PM)
		✘ Data normalization for mountaincar & cartpole -> necessity? @cancelled (5/19/2022, 3:26:23 PM)
		✔ Adapt efficient algs: create set of expected timestamps and remove all unnecessary ones @done (5/19/2022, 2:26:37 PM)
		✔ Basic CNN architecture for cartpole learning @done (5/16/2022, 12:45:30 PM)
		CartPole CNN:
			✔ Implement Cartpole CNN Class @done (5/15/2022, 1:09:27 PM)
			✔ Implement Cartpole CNN train function @done (5/15/2022, 5:49:33 PM)
			✔ Implement Cartpole CNN test function @done (5/15/2022, 5:49:33 PM)
			✔ Implement robustness estimator base class @done (5/15/2022, 6:10:13 PM)
			✔ Implement pre-process function for train data to (CUDA) tensors @done (5/16/2022, 11:06:40 AM)
			✔ Extract similar test/train features into separate function @done (5/16/2022, 12:04:44 PM)
			✔ Extract common base of class, to allow easy mountaincar impl @done (5/16/2022, 12:04:45 PM)
			✔ Find some set of parameters that seems to work with cartpole @done (5/16/2022, 1:06:41 PM)
			✘ Generate a larger set of training data? @cancelled (5/16/2022, 12:04:50 PM)
			✔ Switch C and P signals in cartpole CNN training data: C = index 0, p = index 2 @done (20/5/2022, 16:07:17)
			☐ Train CNN on the new data set
			☐ Test CNN after new data set
				☐ Check how often the sign changes (magnitude being off doesn't matter as much - sign being wrong is important)
				☐ Maybe change formula (e.g. 1.2 margin instead of 2.4 - can argue as safety margin or something)
		Mountaincar CNN:
			☐ Generate (large) mountaincar data for use with CNN learning
			☐ Mountain car learning
		Testing:
			☐ Restructure tests (mirror stl module, rather than tree node)
			☐ Extend test suite (ensure high coverage etc)
		Robustness training:
			☐ Agent train on robustness

	Generic:
		☐ Check cartpoleEstimator timestamp equality requirement
